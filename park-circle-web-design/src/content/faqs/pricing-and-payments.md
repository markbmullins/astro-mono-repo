## How long is your monthly subscription commitment?

At Park Circle Web Design, we ask for a 12‑month minumum commitment on our monthly website packages. After your initial term, you can continue month‑to‑month or opt for a one‑time buyout if you’d prefer to own your site outright.

## What if I need to cancel before the 12 months are up?

If you need to end your subscription prematurely, we do charge a fee to cover the remaining term. This ensures we can fairly compensate our team for their time and resources, which also helps us continue providing high‑quality service to all our clients.

## Do I get a refund if I’m not satisfied?

During the design phase, you may request a refund if you are not satisfied. After that initial design phase, we don’t typically provide refunds because we’ve already invested significant time and energy into designing and implementing your site.

## What forms of payment do you accept?

Park Circle Web Design accepts major credit cards, ACH transfers, and PayPal. We do not currently support checks or money orders.

## Is there an extra charge for additional pages?

For a lump sum contract, we calculate the fee based on the complexity of the website. Simple 5 page websites will be eligibile for our minimum pricing. On the monthly contract, we offer a $200 (one-time) upgrade for each page after 5",

## What happens if my payment is late?

We allow a short grace period for overdue invoices. If payment is still outstanding after that, your site may be placed on hold until the account is brought current. Feel free to reach out if you have any billing concerns, and we’ll do our best to work with you.
