## How long does the web design process usually take?

On average, most sites take two to four weeks to complete. Timelines can vary based on how quickly you provide feedback and content. We work diligently to meet agreed‑upon deadlines.

## Will I own my domain name?

Absolutely. Your domain is yours to keep. If you ever cancel, you can transfer it to another host. However, the site files remain with Park Circle Web Design unless you’ve opted for a buyout or a lump‑sum package.

## Which platform do you use for development?

We primarily build custom WordPress sites. We avoid simple drag‑and‑drop solutions like Wix or Squarespace because we prefer to tailor every aspect for optimal performance, security, and scalability—especially important for growing Charleston businesses.

## Why do you custom code instead of using page builders?

Custom coding allows us to create streamlined, efficient sites that load quickly and handle unique features without extra bloat. This results in better user experiences and SEO performance, particularly if you’re targeting a local audience in Charleston.

## What happens to my site if something unexpected happens to Park Circle Web Design?

We have robust backup systems and a team of specialists, ensuring your site remains secure. In the rare event of an emergency, our protocols keep your website online and your data protected. We take pride in our reliability and support.

## How can I request changes or updates?

We offer a dedicated support channel via email or ticket system. Once we receive your update requests, we schedule them based on your plan level—subscribers with unlimited edits get priority turnaround times, while others follow a queue system.
