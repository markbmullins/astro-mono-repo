## What happens once my 12‑month subscription ends?

After the initial year, your subscription goes month‑to‑month. Many of our Charleston‑based clients stay on because they like having ongoing support, but if you prefer to stop, you’re free to do so. However, canceling means you’ll lose access to your website unless you buy it out.

## Can I purchase my website outright after a year?

Yes. We offer a buyout option after 12 months for those who want to fully own their site. The buyout cost is calculated and agreed upon in the contract.

## Do you offer packages with unlimited support?

We offer monthly upgrade plans that give you access to support, unlimited edits, and SEO maintanence.

## What’s the difference between lump‑sum and subscription plans?

Our lump‑sum packages let you pay once and fully own your site from day one. In contrast, our monthly subscription covers continuous support, hosting, and maintenance for as long as you remain subscribed. Many clients in Charleston and beyond choose subscriptions for the peace of mind and ongoing service.

## Do you build e‑commerce websites on subscription?

Absolutely. We have a specialized e‑commerce plan for online stores, which includes features like payment gateways, shipping setup, and more. If you need advanced functionality like memberships or booking systems, we can accommodate that as well.

## Will I receive any progress reports or analytics?

Yes. We provide periodic updates and performance insights so you can track your website’s growth. These reports may include traffic stats, user engagement, and SEO improvements tailored for Charleston, SC, and the surrounding region.
