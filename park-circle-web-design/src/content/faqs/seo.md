## Do you offer search engine optimization for Charleston‑based businesses?

Yes, local SEO is a major focus for us. We optimize content and technical aspects of your site to help you rank higher in Charleston and the Lowcountry. Our monthly retainers vary depending on your goals and the competitiveness of your niche.

## Why should I add an SEO maintenance plan to my website?

An SEO maintenance plan is vital for long-term online success. Here’s why:

- Adapting to Algorithm Changes: Search engines regularly update their ranking criteria. Regular maintenance ensures your website stays compliant with the latest best practices, protecting and improving your rankings.  

- Technical Health: Routine audits can uncover and fix technical issues—like broken links, slow load times, or mobile responsiveness problems—that might otherwise hurt your SEO performance.

- Competitive Advantage: The digital landscape is constantly evolving. Ongoing optimization helps you stay ahead of competitors who are also updating their sites.

- Sustained Organic Traffic: SEO isn’t a one-time setup. Continuous keyword refinement, content updates, and performance analysis can drive consistent organic traffic.

- Cost Efficiency: Proactive maintenance prevents minor issues from escalating into costly problems, ensuring your investment in SEO delivers long-term returns.

Implementing an SEO maintenance plan means your website remains dynamic, responsive, and aligned with both search engine standards and user expectations.

## How soon can I expect to see SEO results?

SEO is a long‑term strategy, especially for competitive local markets like Charleston. Some clients see noticeable changes within a few months, but we usually advise planning for at least six months of consistent effort.

## What specific SEO services do you provide?

We handle on‑page optimization, keyword research, local listings, technical site improvements, and content creation. Our team also stays current with Google’s algorithm updates, ensuring your site remains optimized for Charleston‑based searches and beyond.

## Do you guarantee top rankings in a short time?

We avoid making unrealistic promises. SEO depends on multiple variables, like your industry, competition, and keyword difficulty. While we strive for high visibility, we don’t claim overnight success. Consistent, quality work is key.

## Can you also help with paid ads (PPC)?

Yes, we offer PPC campaign management alongside our SEO services. This includes Google Ads, social media advertising, and retargeting strategies. If you’re looking for faster visibility in Charleston or nationwide, PPC can be an effective option.
